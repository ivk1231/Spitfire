   - Storage: Transaction data stored locally on SD card or eMMC and synced to cloud.
   - Processing: Categorization of transactions for generating analytics.

2. **Report Generation**
   - Local computation of daily, weekly, and monthly reports.
   - Storage of reports on local memory and optional cloud backup.

3. **Inventory Management**
   - Real-time tracking of stock levels.
   - Low-stock alerts triggered by predefined thresholds.

4. **Billing and Invoicing**
   - Itemized bill generation.
   - Printable receipts via connected thermal printer.

5. **Dynamic QR Code for Payments**
   - QR code generation for UPI-based payments.
   - Display of QR code on the device screen.

6. **Audio Payment Confirmation**
   - Audio notification for successful payments using onboard speaker.

7. **App Integration**
   - Real-time synchronization with a mobile app for transaction and inventory updates.

## Software Components

### 1. Firmware
- **Programming Language**: C++ (Arduino framework) or MicroPython for rapid prototyping.
- **RTOS**: FreeRTOS to manage concurrent tasks like user input, QR code generation, and cloud synchronization.
- **Task Distribution**:
  - Input Handling Task: Manage keypad or touchscreen inputs.
  - QR Code Task: Generate QR codes dynamically based on payment data.
  - Report Task: Calculate and store reports periodically.
  - Sync Task: Handle data uploads and downloads to/from the cloud.

### 2. Communication Protocols
- **Wi-Fi**: For cloud synchronization and app communication.
- **Bluetooth**: Optional pairing with mobile devices for offline data transfer.
- **UART/I2C**: Interface with peripherals like thermal printer and external modules.

### 3. Data Management
- **Local Storage**: SQLite database or JSON files stored on SD card for transaction and inventory data.
- **Cloud Sync**: Firebase or custom backend for real-time data synchronization.
- **Backup Mechanism**: Periodic backups to ensure data integrity.

### 4. QR Code Generation
- **Library**: Use lightweight libraries like "qrcode" (C/C++) for dynamic QR code generation.
- **Display Integration**: Render the QR code on an attached LCD screen.

### 5. User Interface
- **Display**: Touchscreen UI with intuitive menus for operations.
- **Input Handling**: Physical keypad as a fallback for cost-sensitive versions.
- **UX Design**: Minimalistic layout to cater to non-tech-savvy users.

### 6. Payment Integration
- **UPI SDKs**: Integration with APIs for payment confirmation.
- **Security**: TLS encryption for secure transactions.

### 7. Audio Notifications
- **Audio Playback**: Use PWM-based sound generation or external audio modules for payment notifications.
